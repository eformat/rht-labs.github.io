Practice Makes Perfect
======================

> Applying a DevOps model can help you deliver innovative applications with speed and agility. It really is all about collaboration across teams. However, many organizations don‚Äôt know how to get started.
 
In this session of Red Hat‚Äôs developer corner, you‚Äôll have the opportunity to connect with one of the authors of the book, `DevOps Culture and Practice with OpenShift: Deliver continuous business value through people, processes, and technology.` He‚Äôll help you increase your understanding of DevOps, collaboration, and cultural and engineering practices on a container platform such as Red Hat OpenShift. You‚Äôll learn how to make moving to DevOps easier and develop a clearer path for beginning your journey.
